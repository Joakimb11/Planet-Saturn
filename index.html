          Saturn, the gas giant, boasts iconic rings and myriad moons. With a

      <p>
        The planet Saturn, a gas giant dominated by hydrogen and helium, lacks a
        defined surface but likely has a solid core. Its rotation gives it an
        oblate spheroid shape, flattened at the poles and bulging at the
        equator. With an equatorial radius over 10% larger than its polar radius
        (60,268 km vs. 54,364 km), Saturn's effective surface gravity is 74% at
        the equator compared to the poles. Despite being less dense than water,
        Saturn's core is denser, yielding an average specific density of 0.69
        g/cm³ due to its atmosphere. With 95 times Earth's mass, Saturn, along
        with Jupiter, holds 92% of the Solar System's total planetary mass.

          Saturn houses most of its mass in a non-ideal liquid phase due to the
          transition from gas to liquid at a density above 0.01 g/cm3. The
          interior structure is similar to Jupiter, featuring a small rocky core
          enveloped by hydrogen and helium, with trace volatiles. Saturn's core
          is denser than Jupiter, containing approximately 50% hydrogen by mass.
          The core, estimated to be 9–22 times Earth's mass, exhibits a complex
          structure with a liquid metallic hydrogen layer and a surrounding
          layer of helium-saturated molecular hydrogen. Saturn's hot interior,
          reaching temperatures of 11,700 °C at its core, results in significant
          energy radiation, exceeding its solar input. This thermal energy
          generation remains a topic of study, with potential contributions from
          the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism and heat produced by the "raining out"
          of helium droplets within Saturn's interior. The atmosphere of Saturn
          consists predominantly of molecular hydrogen (96.3%) and helium
          (3.25%). Its cloud layers exhibit a banded pattern similar to Jupiter,
          with varying compositions at different depths and pressures. The
          presence of ammonia, acetylene, ethane, propane, phosphine, and
          methane has been detected. Saturn experiences periodic storms, such as
          the Great White Spot, occurring approximately every 30 Earth years.
          Saturn's winds, the second fastest in the Solar System after
          Neptune's, reach speeds of 500 m/s (1,800 km/h). The planet displays a
          blue hue in its northern hemisphere, likely caused by Rayleigh
          scattering. Unique features include a warm polar vortex at the south
          pole, with temperatures as high as −122 °C, making it the warmest spot
          on Saturn.

      <h2>Myths</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn, a god in ancient Roman religion and mythology, was associated
        with time, abundance, wealth, and agriculture. His reign was considered
        a Golden Age of peace and prosperity. After the Roman conquest of
        Greece, Saturn was merged with the Greek Titan Cronus. Saturn's consort
        was Ops, and together they parented Jupiter, Neptune, Pluto, Juno,
        Ceres, and Vesta. Saturn was honored during the festival of Saturnalia
        in December, known for feasting, role reversals, and revelry. The Temple
        of Saturn in the Roman Forum housed the state treasury. The planet
        Saturn and Saturday are named after him. In Roman mythology, Saturn and
        Janus were believed to have ruled the site of Rome before its
        foundation. Saturn was identified with the Greek Cronus, and Jupiter was
        considered his son. Saturn's mistresses represented different aspects of
        the god, including Ops, associated with wealth and abundance. During
        Saturn's rule, humanity experienced a "Golden Age" of spontaneous bounty
        from the earth without labor. He became known as the god of time.

      <p>
        Saturn is widely recognized for its striking planetary rings. Stretching
        from 6,630 to 120,700 kilometers outward from Saturn's equator, these
        rings are about 20 meters thick. Composed mainly of water ice with trace
        impurities, they also have a coating of roughly 7% amorphous carbon.
        Saturn's rings are the largest and most visible among the gas giants.
        There are two main theories about the origin of the rings. One suggests
        they are remnants of a shattered moon, possibly named "Chrysalis." The
        second proposes that they are leftovers from the original material that
        formed Saturn, with some ice in the E ring coming from Enceladus's
        geysers. Meteor bombardment may explain the varying water abundance in
        the rings. Beyond the main rings, at 12 million km from the planet, is
        the sparse Phoebe ring. It orbits in retrograde fashion at a 27° angle
        to the other rings. Moons like Pandora and Prometheus act as shepherd
        moons, preventing the rings from spreading out. Some moons cause density
        waves in Saturn's rings, aiding in mass calculations. Recent studies
        suggest that Saturn's rings may have formed from the collision of two
        moons a few hundred million years ago, according to astronomers' reports
        in September 2023.

      <h2>Moons</h2>
      <p>
        Saturn boasts 146 moons, 63 with formal names, and an estimated
        additional 100±30 outer irregular moons larger than 3 km in diameter.
        Moonlets with 40–500 meters diameter in Saturn's rings are not
        considered true moons. Titan, the largest moon, holds over 90% of
        Saturn's orbital mass, including its rings. Rhea, the second-largest
        moon, may have a faint ring system and a thin atmosphere. Most of
        Saturn's moons are small, with 131 having a diameter less than 50 km.
        Traditionally, they are named after Titans from Greek mythology. Titan,
        unique in the Solar System, has a significant atmosphere and hydrocarbon
        lakes. In 2013, scientists detected polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in
        Titan's upper atmosphere, a potential precursor for life. NASA later
        claimed nitrogen in Titan's atmosphere originated from the Oort cloud,
        associated with comets. Enceladus, chemically similar to comets, is
        considered a potential habitat for microbial life. Cassini's 2015 flyby
        found ingredients to sustain life forms in its plumes. In 2014, NASA
        reported a potential new moon within Saturn's A Ring, imaged by Cassini
        in April 2013.
